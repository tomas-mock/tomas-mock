## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of
Here’s a snapshot of my work:

### 1. 🌌 **Galaxy Morphology Prediction**
- **What it is**: Leveraged deep learning (CNNs) to classify galaxy morphologies using thousands of galaxy images.
- **Key Features**: Parallel CNN architecture, Grad-CAM for explainability.
- [View Project](https://github.com/tomas-mock/Galaxy-Morphologies)

### 2. 🎰 **Roulette Strategies Simulation**
- **What it is**: Simulated and analyzed roulette betting strategies to evaluate outcomes and risks.
- **Key Features**: Explored strategies like James Bond, D'Alembert, and Red/Black bets using R.
- [View Project](https://github.com/tomas-mock/Roulette-Strategies)

### 3. 🏥 **ER Visits Trends in California**
- **What it is**: Analyzed Emergency Room visits (2011–2019) using Bayesian models to identify key drivers like PM2.5 levels and demographics.
- **Key Features**: Spatio-temporal modeling with R-INLA, insights for public health policies.
- [View Project](https://github.com/tomas-mock/Bayesian-Hierarchical-Modelling)

### 4. 💷 **Household Expenditure Patterns in the UK**
- **What it is**: Investigated how income, tenure, and children affect spending across UK regions.
- **Key Features**: Bayesian hierarchical models (Nimble, STAN), comparison with frequentist methods.
- [View Project](https://github.com/tomas-mock/Bayesian-Data-Analysis)

### 5. 📈 **Macroeconomic Impacts on U.S. Business Sectors**
- **What it is**: Explored the influence of macroeconomic indicators on sector performance over two decades.
- **Key Features**: Sector performance analysis during recessions and recoveries.
