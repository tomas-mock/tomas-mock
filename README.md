## 🛠️ Projects I'm Proud Of
Here’s a snapshot of my work:

### 1. 🤖 **FX Signal Generation with Transformers**  
- **What it is**: Applied encoder-only Transformer models to predict directional moves in the mid-frequency FX spot market using hourly OHLC data from 2013–2023.  
- **Key Features**: Custom three-class labeling framework, context window tuning, local vs. learnable positional encodings, Focal Loss for class imbalance, XGBoost benchmark, and realistic backtesting.

### 2. 🌌 **Galaxy Morphology Prediction**
- **What it is**: Leveraged deep learning (CNNs) to classify galaxy morphologies using thousands of galaxy images.
- **Key Features**: Parallel CNN architecture, Grad-CAM for explainability.

### 3. 🎰 **Roulette Strategies Simulation**
- **What it is**: Simulated and analysed roulette betting strategies to evaluate outcomes and risks.
- **Key Features**: Explored strategies like James Bond, D'Alembert, and Red/Black bets using R.

### 4. 🏥 **ER Visits Trends in California**
- **What it is**: Analysed Emergency Room visits (2011–2019) using Bayesian models to identify key drivers like PM2.5 levels and demographics.
- **Key Features**: Spatio-temporal modeling with R-INLA, insights for public health policies.

### 5. 💷 **Household Expenditure Patterns in the UK**
- **What it is**: Investigated how income, tenure, and children affect spending across UK regions.
- **Key Features**: Bayesian hierarchical models (Nimble, STAN), comparison with frequentist methods.

### 6. 📈 **Macroeconomic Impacts on U.S. Business Sectors**
- **What it is**: Explored the influence of macroeconomic indicators on sector performance over two decades.
- **Key Features**: Sector performance analysis during recessions and recoveries.

### 7. 🕸️ **Social Network Analysis of Lawyer Relationships**  
- **What it is**: Analyzed professional and social ties among lawyers using Advice, CoWork, and Friendship networks to understand collaboration, hierarchy, and homophily within a law firm.  
- **Key Features**: ERGM modeling, assortativity analysis, configuration model comparison, Walktrap community detection, and interpretation of reciprocity, transitivity, and tie patterns.
